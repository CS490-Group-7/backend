## Setup your local Express JS server: 

#### 1. Copy and paste file `.env.local-template`
#### 2. Rename new pasted file to `.env.local` (this file is git ignored for security and adaptability)
#### 3. Adjust values in `.env.local` for your local MySQL credentials to get a succesful connection

## In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Installs all required packages

### `npm run dev`
Starts and runs the server locally in development mode and connects with your local MySQL database

### `npm run swagger`
Generates Swagger API Documentation. Visit `http://localhost:4000/doc` after running npm run dev to view it.
